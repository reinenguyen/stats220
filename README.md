# Hong Hanh Nguyen's STATS 220 repo

## About me:

- I'm an international student from Vietnam
- I am undertaking a degree in Data Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to graduate ðŸ˜­
- I **adore** shorebirds and often take birdwatching trips to preservation sites around Auckland. They just look so *goofy*. Here's a picture I took of a spotted redshank while it was choking on a fish (*it's blurry I know*)
